# Musicbrainz Files

These are my Musicbrainz related utilities.

## File Renaming Script

[The naming script](FileRenaming.pts) is my currently used script.
It is based on [MBP YA Magic-Script](https://gist.github.com/xstefen/820c9b9e8cbe668a2d01d2ff60c69d24)
but all the customization is already been done and the switches are removed.
It formats the directory tree in a way that syncing music to my android
using Syncthing is not messed up.
It renames files to be easy to find.

## Tagger Script

Not using right now; but not sure if I will use it.
